# Key Features and Architecture

The Cetus CLMM protocol implements a sophisticated concentrated liquidity AMM with several innovative features that distinguish it from traditional decentralized exchanges.

## Concentrated Liquidity Architecture

At the core of Cetus CLMM is the concentrated liquidity model, which allows liquidity providers to specify exact price ranges where their liquidity is active. This dramatically improves capital efficiency compared to traditional constant product AMMs by focusing liquidity where it's most needed.

### Tick-Based Pricing

The system uses discrete tick-based pricing instead of continuous price curves. This approach:
- Enables precise liquidity positioning at specific price levels
- Reduces computational overhead through efficient data structures
- Allows for granular control over liquidity placement
- Maintains mathematical precision in price calculations

### Liquidity Positioning

Liquidity providers can create positions with:
- Customizable price ranges (tick boundaries)
- Granular liquidity concentration
- Efficient fee collection within position ranges
- Reward distribution based on active liquidity

## Core Protocol Features

### Multi-Reward System

The protocol supports multiple reward tokens simultaneously:
- Up to 5 reward tokens per pool
- Point-based incentive system for enhanced liquidity provision
- Flexible emission rates for each reward token
- Comprehensive reward tracking for individual positions

### Permission-Based Pool Creation

Security and governance are maintained through:
- Capability-based pool creation controls
- Whitelist/blacklist management for coin types
- Configurable fee tiers and tick spacings
- Administrative oversight for protocol operations

### Flash Loan Support

Advanced DeFi functionality includes:
- Atomic flash loans for arbitrage and other strategies
- Secure execution environments
- Proper fee handling for flash loan operations
- Integration with the broader liquidity ecosystem

### Protocol Fee Collection

Revenue sharing through:
- Configurable fee rates (typically 0.03% to 0.3%)
- Automatic fee collection and distribution
- Protocol fee reserve management
- Fee-based governance mechanisms

## System Integration

The modular architecture ensures seamless interaction between components:
- Pool module coordinates all trading and liquidity operations
- Position module handles user-facing position management
- Factory module controls pool lifecycle and permissions
- Rewarder module distributes incentives to liquidity providers
- Tick module manages discrete price points and liquidity distribution

This integrated design creates a robust, scalable, and secure decentralized exchange infrastructure that can adapt to evolving DeFi needs while maintaining high capital efficiency.
